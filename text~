The Interstate Highways in Michigan are the segments of the national Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways[3] that are owned and maintained by the U.S. state of Michigan,[4] totaling about 1,239 miles (1,994 km).[2] The longest of these, Interstate 75 (I-75), is also the longest highway of any kind in the state.[5] On a national level, the standards and numbering for the system are handled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), while the highways in Michigan are maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The Interstates in Michigan have their origins in World War II-era expressways built in the Detroit area. After the system was created in 1956, the state highway department completed its first border-to-border Interstate in 1960. The last highway was completed in 1992, giving Michigan a total of 13 Interstate freeways. The original allotment of mileage to Michigan which would receive federal funding was expanded in 1968, and the United States Congress designated an additional highway in the 1990s that has not yet been built.

There are also 26 current business routes that connect cities bypassed by the Interstates; 23 are business loops that connect on both ends to their parent highway, and three are business spurs that connect on only one end. I-496 has the Capitol Loop as its connection to the Michigan State Capitol in downtown Lansing. Another six business routes have been designated but are either no longer signed or maintained as state highways.

Description

MDOT is the agency responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the State Trunkline Highway System, which includes the Interstate Highways in Michigan. These highways are built to Interstate Highway standards,[6] meaning they are all freeways with minimum requirements for full control of access, design speeds of 50 to 70 miles per hour (80 to 113 km/h) depending on type of terrain, a minimum of two travel lanes in each direction, and specific widths of lanes or shoulders;[7] exceptions from these standards have to be approved by the FHWA.[8] The numbering scheme used to designate the Interstates was developed by AASHTO, an organization composed of the various state departments of transportation in the United States.[9]

The Interstate Highway System covers about 1,240 miles (2,000 km) in the state and consists of four primary highways and nine auxiliary highways. There are additional 29 business routes associated with the system in Michigan. The longest segment of Interstate Highway in the state is Interstate 75 (I-75) at just under 396 miles (637 km); the shortest is I-375 at 1.1 miles (1.8 km). The length of I-75, the longest highway of any kind in the state,[5] includes the Mackinac Bridge, which is maintained by the MBA, the only section of state highway not under MDOT jurisdiction.[a] The Mackinac Bridge is one of three monumental bridges in the state used by I-75; the others are the Zilwaukee and International bridges. A fourth, the privately owned Ambassador Bridge connects I-75 and I-96 in Detroit to Canada.[11]
History

Construction of the first expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD)[b] built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from Detroit to the defense plants at Willow Run Airport.[14] The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951,[15] which proposed the construction of a toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood.[16] Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes[17] while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.[18]

The Interstate Highway System was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956,[1] and the state had already designed several freeways for its portion of that system. Seizing the opportunity brought by a 1957 state law, the department sold $700 million in bonds (equivalent to $13.4 billion in 2011[19]) in the late 1950s and early 1960s to finance land purchases and construction of the new freeways. The goal was to connect every city with a population over 50,000 with four-lane freeways that could accommodate rural traffic traveling at 70 mph (110 km/h).[18] The MSHD delayed numbering these freeways as part of the Interstate Highway System until the federal government had finalized the designations to be assigned to Michigan's freeways.[20] The first highway to be signed as an Interstate in Michigan was I-75, which received signage in late 1959, along a section near the Ohio state line that opened to traffic in October 1957.[21][22] I-94 was the first of the Interstates to be completed border to border in a US state.[23] In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the Interstates in Michigan.[24]

The MSHD asked for 600 miles (970 km) in additions to the state's Interstate mileage in 1968. Included in these requests were the extension of the Davison Freeway (now M-8), the extension of I-69 from Marshall to Port Huron, and the conversion of the northern sections of US Highway 23 (US 23) and US 131.[25] Of these, the I-69 proposal was approved when the United States Congress extended it to terminate in at I-75 in Flint. The highway was lengthened twice more: to I-475 in 1973 and to Port Huron on February 10, 1987.[26] These last two extensions were classified non-chargeable mileage, or segments not financed through the Interstate Highway fund.[27] The federal government paid 90 percent of the cost of the chargeable mileage originally approved.[18]

The last of Michigan's Interstates to be completed was I-69, the last segment of which opened in 1992.[28] Since then, the United States Congress has designated an additional primary Interstate, I-73 in the state. All studies by MDOT on that highway were cancelled in 2001 over funding concerns.[29] Press reports state there is a "lack of need" for the freeway in the state,[30] and the department has no plans to revive I-73 as of 2011.[31] If built as designated, I-73 would cross into Michigan near Toledo, Ohio, and connect Jackson, Lansing, and Clare to I-75 at Grayling.[

These standards are, as of July 2007, as follows:

    Controlled access: All access onto and off the roadway is to be controlled with interchanges and grade separations (including railroad crossings). See List of gaps in Interstate Highways for the few cases that violate this rule. Interchanges should provide full access; ramps are to be designed with the appropriate standards in mind. Minimum interchange spacing should be 1 mi (1.6 km) in urban areas and 3 mi (4.8 km) in rural areas; collector/distributor roads or other configurations that reduce weaving can be used in urban areas to shorten this distance.
        Access control (from adjacent properties) should extend at least 100 feet (30 m) in urban areas and 300 feet (91 m) in rural areas in each direction along the crossroad from the ramps.
    Minimum design speed: In rural areas, a minimum design speed of 70 mph (115 km/h) should be used, with 50–60 mph (80–95 km/h) acceptable in rolling terrain, and as low as 50 mph (80 km/h) allowed in mountainous and urban areas.[1] Speed limits as low as 40 mph (65 km/h) are, however, occasionally encountered and generally assigned to pre-existing freeways that were grandfathered into the system.[citation needed]
        Sight distance, curvature and superelevation according to the current edition of AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets for the design speed.[1]
    Maximum grade: Maximum grade is determined by a design table based on terrain and design speeds,[1] with up to 6% generally allowed in mountainous areas and hilly urban areas with exceptions for up to 7% grades on mountainous roads with speed limits below 60 mph (95 km/h).
    Minimum number of lanes: At least two lanes in each direction, and more if necessary for an acceptable level of service in the design year, according to the current edition of AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. Climbing lanes and emergency escape ramps should be provided where appropriate. Brief one-lane ramps that either "deviate" off of multi-lane freeways to connect and merge with another freeway (or one-lane bottlenecks for less than a mile before another merging freeway) are exempt from this requirement, these exceptions are mostly in rural areas.
    Minimum lane width: Minimum lane width of 12 feet (3.7 m). Also for most US and state highways.
    Shoulder width: Minimum outside paved shoulder width of 10 feet (3.0 m) and inside shoulder width of 4 feet (1.2 m). With three or more lanes in each direction, the inside paved shoulder should be at least 10 feet (3.0 m) wide. If truck traffic is over 250 Directional Design Hour Volume, shoulders at least 12 feet (3.7 m) wide should be considered. In mountainous terrain, 8 feet (2.4 m) outside and 4 feet (1.2 m) inside shoulders are acceptable, except when there are at least four lanes in each direction, in which case the inside shoulders should also be 8 feet (2.4 m) wide.
    Pavement sloping: Pavement cross slope of at least 1.5% and preferably 2% to ensure proper drainage on flat sections. This can be increased to 2.5% in areas of heavy rainfall. Shoulder cross slope should be between 2% and 6% but not less than the main lanes.
        Land slopes within the clear zone should be at most 4:1 and preferably 6:1 or flatter. Roadside barriers should be used for slopes of 3:1 or steeper, in accordance with the current edition of AASHTO's Roadside Design Guide.
    Median width: Minimum median width of 36 feet (11 m) in rural areas, and 10 feet (3.0 m) in urban or mountainous areas. To prevent median-crossing accidents, guard rail or Jersey barrier should be installed in medians in accordance with the current edition of AASHTO's Roadside Design Guide, based on traffic, median width and crash history. When possible, median openings between parallel bridges less than 30 feet (9.1 m) in width should be decked over; otherwise barriers or guard rails should be installed to exclude vehicles from the gap. Recently, cable median barriers are being installed on busier Interstate Highways in rural areas regardless of median width.
    Recovery areas: No fixed objects should be in the clear recovery area, determined by the design speed in accordance with the current edition of AASHTO's Roadside Design Guide. When this is not possible, breakaway supports or barriers guarding the objects shall be used.
    Curb slope: Vertical curbs are prohibited. Sloping curbs are to be at the edge of the paved shoulder, with a maximum height of 100 millimetres (3.9 in). The combination of curbs and guard rail is discouraged; in this case the guard rail should be closer to the road than the curb.
    Vertical clearance: Minimum vertical clearance under overhead structures (including over the paved shoulders) of 16 feet (4.9 m) in rural areas and 14 feet (4.3 m) in urban areas, with allowance for extra layers of pavement. Through urban areas at least one routing should have 16-foot (4.9 m) clearances. Sign supports and pedestrian overpasses must be at least 17 feet (5.2 m) above the road, except on urban routes with lesser clearance, where they should be at least 1 foot (30 cm) higher than other objects.
    Horizontal clearance: under or along a bridge shall be the full paved width of the rest of the road. Bridges longer than 200 feet (61 m) can be narrower, with a minimum of 4 feet (1.2 m) on both sides of the travel lanes.
    Bridge strength: New bridges are to have at least MS 18 (HS-20) structural capacity. Weaker bridges that can continue to serve the route for 20 more years are allowed to remain.
        Additionally, existing bridges can remain if they have at least 12-foot-wide (3.7 m) lanes with 10-foot (3.0 m) outside and 3.5-foot (1.1 m) inside shoulders. Long bridges are to have at least 3.5 feet (1.1 m) on each side of the travel lanes; bridge railing should be upgraded to current standards if necessary.
    Tunnel clearance: Tunnels should in theory be equivalent to long overcrossings, but because of cost the standards can be reduced. Vertical clearance is the same as under bridges, including the provision for alternate routing. Width should be at least 44 feet (13 m), which consists of two 12-foot-wide (3.7 m) lanes, 10-foot (3.0 m) outside and 5-foot (1.5 m) inside shoulders, and 2.5-foot (76 cm) safety walkways on each side. If necessary to meet the dimensions of the approach, this can be shifted left or right. A reduced width is acceptable due to high cost. In this case, the minimum width is 30 feet (9.1 m), with at least 2 feet (61 cm) more than the approach for the sum of the shoulder widths, but at least 24 feet (7.3 m) total, and at least 1.5 feet (46 cm) on each side for a safety walkway. If there is no safety walkway, a 3-foot (91 cm) offset with a "safety shape" in the wall is acceptable.
